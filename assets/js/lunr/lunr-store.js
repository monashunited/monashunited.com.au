        "excerpt":"We Need Your Help.   If you are a golfer, tennis player, resident, community member or care for our environment, please get involved and share your concerns and ask the Councillors who represent you questions.   Questions   RESIDENTS &amp; COMMUNITY      Why was community not consulted before the deal was done and the contract signed?   Can Council show the community the Expression of Interest submitted to North East Link Project?  If not, why not?   What pre-work was done before the Council decided on the project before Dec 2020 and when did it commence?   Why does Monash need to pay for this facility when there is no business case for it, nor is it in the current strategic plan?   Council will be contributing $5.77 million of Monash funds. This was not previously budgeted for, where will these funds come from?   This complex will add significant traffic to the area, will you be upgrading roads to cope and what is the benefit to Monash residents?   Why are you displacing the Halcyon dementia support centre?   How can you buffer noise and visual impact from residents’ current views and quiet enjoyment?   How significant will the drainage be considering the area floods regularly?   What environmental and ecological studies did you, or will you do?   How much soil and earth works will need to be completed?   Council often refers to community surveys as the basis for informing decisions.  Community members who answered the Tennis Survey say that had they known the intent was around a large tennis complex they would have answered the survey very differently.  Does Council feel that these surveys are transparent enough in their intent?   TENNIS      Why has council appeared to underfund tennis infrastructure over the past 10yrs in Monash?   Why did you not consult tennis players for their needs prior to submission?   It has been indicated that local tennis clubs will be forced to relocate. What does this mean? Will the Council make conditions onerous when the lease is renewed such that members have no option but to move?   What will be the cost to the displaced tennis players who are forced to move to the new centre? Information from Boroondara tennis centre is that court hire weekdays up to 5 pm is $30/hr and weekends and after 5pm $38/hr. There is no allowance for an annual club membership. What will be the availability of courts at the tennis centre?   What happens to displaced local tennis players and interclub competition when tournaments are in progress?   (Boroondara advertise that they have 40 tournaments each year which they say may be the highest number of tennis tournaments held at any venue in Australia).   Is this facility to be a commercial tennis facility with show courts and tournaments?  How many tournaments will be held each year.  Is the amount of tournaments a condition of the agreement with NELP?   Is North East Link and the State Government dictating what is “required” in the courts form and surfaces?   What will the playing surface be on the new Federation (ITF) standard courts?   GOLF      Why should golfers lose their driving range for tennis?   The driving range is always busy, what evidence was used to measure the current usage of the driving range?   Do you expect Golf membership to decrease with the removal of the driving range?   How long do you expect golf users to be impacted by construction or how long will the course be closed?   Can you promise the sound level of PA systems will not ruin the quiet enjoyment and focus of golfers?

        "excerpt":"A secret deal between the State Government and local Council will see Monash Council accept $21m to relocate Boroondara Tennis Tournament Complex to Glen Waverley Golf Course so the North East Link freeway interchange can be built.   This decision was made in confidential business without any consultation of the local community or sporting users and will come at a cost of $5.77m to Monash Taxpayers through additional council funding.   This will come at a huge loss for the Monash Community. The plans include clearing 3.4 hectares of green space, demolition of the Halycon dementia facility, and the loss of established trees &amp; bird life as the green open spaces of the Glen Waverley Golf Course Driving Range is converted into 18 hard surface tennis courts.   Consequently local residents can expect an enormous increase in traffic and noise in the area. In addition the demolition of the Halycon dementia facility is wasteful and most importantly impacts dementia patients who value continuity and familiarity.   There has been no business case or environmental report provided as yet, and council is now pressuring local community tennis clubs to relocate to this bigger tournament scale complex. What will happen to the small community connections at these clubs which make it a safe a fun environment for adults and children to learn and play.   This wasn’t good enough for the Boroondara, Manningham, Banyule and Whitehorse Councils who took North East Link Project to the Supreme Court.  So why is it good enough for Monash?   The local Government Act 2020 states that Councils need to consult with their community before making decisions of this type in a transparent way.

        "excerpt":"To all Tennis Members   As members of the Monash local tennis clubs you may have recently been made aware of Monash Council’s announcement that they have accepted $21m from the State Government to build an 18-court public tennis facility at the Glen Waverley Golf Club on the driving range.   The new tennis centre is supposed to replace the existing 23-court tennis centre in Boroondara (30 kilometres away), currently located on land needed for the North East Link Project (NELP).  Council’s contribution to the project will be $5.77M of Monash ratepayers money.   This announcement was made without any prior community consultation and has raised some serious concerns among the tennis community about what the future of local club tennis looks like in Monash. Further investigation by residents, and various club tennis members, has revealed that to get this facility operable it is council’s intention to shut down a number of local tennis clubs and relocate them into this new complex.   In fact, the statement on the Northeast link website reads “The new tennis centre is expected to open in early 2024, with local tennis clubs moving in soon after.”   As residents, tennis members, and also with young children who learn tennis, we have some serious concerns about this proposal which effects everyone:      Tennis is already well serviced in Monash with tennis courts some of which are underutilised. The amalgamation of local clubs does not require the creation of a new impersonal tennis centre.   The majority of tennis players prefer the more intimate social environment of their existing clubs rather than that of a large tennis centre. As you know there are many more benefits that just tennis for the current Monash tennis clubs. For example, as you know, Legend Park has a vibrant multicultural membership who have become socially integrated with the community. A large centre will not provide this opportunity for smaller group socialisation.   Leases for many tennis clubs in Monash are due for renewal later this year. We believe council may use this as leverage to force clubs to close or be given very short leases.   What will happen to the coaching organisations and the coaches employed by them? They can’t all move to the complex.   When tournaments are in progress club members and coaches will not be able to access the courts   We are deeply concerned that local Tennis Clubs in Monash will be asked to close if this development goes ahead as planned.   As such, we seek your support in communicating these concerns around the future of local tennis clubs in Monash to all the members of your club by sharing this information with them as well as communicating your concerns to Councillors, see the list of sample questions to ask Council here and who to contact.

        "excerpt":"TO ALL GOLFERS   DRIVING RANGE AT RISK IN MONASH   As members or players at the Glen Waverley Golf Course you may have recently been made aware of Monash Council’s announcement that they have accepted $21m from the State Government to build an 18-court public tennis facility at the Glen Waverley Golf Club on the driving range.   The plan – to replace the courts being demolished in Boroondara to make way for the North East Link freeway interchange – was developed with NO consultation with the residents of Monash City Council prior to the announcement of the $21m deal with the Victorian State Government, and raises serious concerns among the golfing community.   In order to build this facility, Council has revealed the existing driving range will be removed and replaced with tennis courts.   The Glen Waverley Golf course is currently a beautiful and quiet environment, providing important health and wellbeing benefits for golfers and the wider community. If the 18 tennis courts are built on the golf course, it will result in the loss of the practice driving range, a large part of open parkland as well as the health benefits of golf enjoyed by the community using the Glen Waverley Golf Course.   Golfers have some serious concerns about this proposal including:      Without a suitable driving range, the ability for young people to learn how to play golf, and experienced players to hone their skills will be greatly diminished. This in turn could affect future golf club membership at Glen Waverley Golf Course. As any golfer knows, practice nets are not enough. Understanding ball flight is just as important as making contact with the ball.   The proposed 18-court public tennis facility will generate more noise from increased traffic, constant tennis playing from 7am to 11pm and shouted line calls. If the proposed show courts and tournaments eventuate there will likely be a public address system, used to broadcast play. The potential noise increase from all these activities will be a distraction and annoyance to golfers who may choose to play elsewhere.   The Glen Waverley Golf Course is the ONLY public golf course in Monash City Council. It is the only course with a driving range to allow new participants and golfers to practice.  We currently have 45 tennis Courts available to the Monash Community and only 1 driving range.   From the 2017 Community Consultation Report, the Monash Council is fully aware that the top most important health and wellbeing priority for Monash community members is getting outdoors to use parklands, reserves or playgrounds (67% of respondents) as opposed to only 17% for outdoor sports courts.   Golf offers 5 mental health benefits to participants; Reduced anxiety, improved social interaction, reduced effects of depression, lower stress levels as well as providing a form of therapy through engaging the community and the natural environment.   The entire Monash community needs to monitor the Monash Council’s actions in relation to this issue and those actions will demonstrate whether the Council is acting in the genuine interests of its community, or not.   If you value the benefits golf brings you, we seek your support in communicating the above concerns around the future of golf in Monash to all the members of your club by sharing this information with them as well as communicating your concerns to Councillors, see the list of sample questions to ask Council here and who to contact.

        "title": "Monash Residents Lose to Monash Council",
        "excerpt":"To the Monash Community &amp; Residents   Monash Councillors sacrifice their constituents rights to progress State Government’s NE Toll Road   In a secret deal made with the State Government, Monash Council agreed in principle to forfeit 3.4 hectares of the Glen Waverley Public Golf Course land in order to solve a problem faced by the State’s NE Link Project team.   To build the Eastern Freeway / NE Link interchange, there was a need to relocate the 23 courts at the Boroondara Tennis Centre. Previously the NE Project team had tried to place the courts near the Centre’s current location, by reducing the holes of a nearby golf course down to 9, but had been faced with court action by Boroondara, and three other councils.   The decision to accept $21 million from the State Government to place 18 tennis courts (of which 14 will be tournament standard, hard surface) on the Glen Waverley Golf Course land, and to contribute $5.77 million from Monash coffers, was made by Monash Councillors, in Confidential Business on 15 Dec 2020 -  without consulting any of the affected stakeholders beforehand.   Stakeholders are concerned   Golfers are extremely unhappy with the prospect of losing their practice driving range and adjacent chip and putt.   They fear this loss will dissuade “beginners””” and coaches will lose clients.   They worry that without these assets the golf club membership (and income) will drop as the course will be less appealing.   In addition, the new commercial facility will be classed as multi-purpose and a proposed new function/ clubhouse will be shared with the tennis clubs as will the expanded parking area on site.   When tennis tournaments (Boroondara Tennis Centre hosts 40 per annum) are played, silence will not be  interrupted by birds chirping, but the sounds of spectators and amplified line calls.   The residents whose properties abut the golf course are devastated. Instead of enjoying a green vista they face the prospect of rows of bright blue courts, radiating the summer heat and operating 7 days a week, from 7am, and floodlit till 10pm.   Established local tennis clubs which historically service their immediate neighbourhoods are not overjoyed at the prospect of  being forced to move to a soulless complex, kilometres away.   A co-location will strip away their clubs’ identities. They do not wish to share commercially operated licensed clubrooms with golfers (and this stance is applicable vice versa).   The existing tennis clubs are adamant their members will not be willing to play on the hard surface courts proposed – citing that the injury risk is magnified.   It’s been noted that the State Government has provided a grant to Golf Victoria in order to create a strategy to promote participation in the game.   https://www.golf.org.au/vic-golf-infrastructure-strategy   It seems counterproductive to all concerned that the same government expects the golf sporting code to acquiesce to another, for a road.  Many are stunned that a Council would be willing to trash its own perfectly good community facility – its premier public golf course, in order to fix an infrastructure  problem faced elsewhere by a state government authority. There is no benefit to Monash stakeholders.   At a time when global warming  is front of mind for all, it is ironic that golf, the one sport which supports Climate Change initiatives is to fall victim to another code that doesn’t.  Golf is one of the few sports which encourages participation across all age groups;  fosters enhanced mental health; requires large areas of open space where trees support carbon capture and provide shade for natural cooling; and protects habitats for native wildlife.  This golf course is adjacent to the Dandenong Creek and associated parklands.   Golf, not tennis, provides positive answers to both the City of Monash’s Open Space, and Urban Landscape and Canopy Vegetation Strategies, passed in 2018.   On the other hand, the non-porous surfaces of tournament quality tennis courts and associated parking bays proposed for this “relocated” Tennis Centre,  will radiate heat and exacerbate drainage problems on site.   Last, but not least, the Active Monash Sports Club Framework (Item 2.3 Council Meeting 25 Aug 2020) at Platinum Accreditation Level awards an incentive for clubs to be alcohol free. Yet the NE Link media release boasts that the new tennis complex will incorporate a large shared function centre. Currently various licences and licensees are in play depending on the tennis and golf clubs involved. Future control over alcohol sales and access to licensed facilities will be transferred to a commercial operator. It is feared that under-aged  players will be exposed unnecessarily to licensed premises.   A Fit for Purpose Alternative Site   Objectors have provided the Monash Council with suggestions for alternative sites to place the Tennis Court Complex, which does not require access via council roads, instead, is easily accessible from Eastlink, M1, M3 and arterial roads. The Tennis Centre Complex could be accommodated on one of two ovals that are to the right when entering Jells Park from Ferntree Gully Road. The location is already serviced by bike and walking tracks, plenty of parking, toilets, a playground and picnic shelters. This would bring the complex back into state hands. It would save the golf driving range, the chip and putt green, the off leash dog park and the Halcyon Social Support Centre; as well as ensure the identities of the Glen Waverley Golf Club and established local tennis clubs are maintained. There would be no need to forfeit 3.4 hectares of golf course land and there would be no more loss of trees.   However Monash Council would need to refuse the $21 million offered by NELP to secure the deal – but it would save its own $5.77 million contribution.   Community members believe keeping the beautiful 18 hole Glen Waverley Course intact is a goal worth fighting for.
