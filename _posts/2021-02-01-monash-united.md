## Welcome to Monash United!

This community group exist to unite all of the community groups to give us single powerfull voice!

## We Need Your Help!

Keep Monash Council Accountable!

Monash Councillors have done a secret deal to build a significant sporting infrastructure east of Melbourne, a 26mil Tennis Complex located on Glen Waverley Golf Course ... at your expense!

If you are ...

* A ratepayer,
* a golfer, 
* a tennis player,
* a lover of nature, 
* or care about mental health services, help us find a better way.

Our rates will go up, we will lose trees and the open spaces we love, local tennis clubs will close, and traffic will increase.
Show your support by joining our group and stay up to date with what's happening.
