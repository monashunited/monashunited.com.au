## We Need Your Help.

If you are a golfer, tennis player, resident, community member or care for our environment, please get involved and share your concerns and ask the Councillors who represent you questions.

## Questions

### RESIDENTS & COMMUNITY

*   Why was community not consulted before the deal was done and the contract signed?
*   Can Council show the community the Expression of Interest submitted to North East Link Project?  If not, why not?
*   What pre-work was done before the Council decided on the project before Dec 2020 and when did it commence?
*   Why does Monash need to pay for this facility when there is no business case for it, nor is it in the current strategic plan?
*   Council will be contributing $5.77 million of Monash funds. This was not previously budgeted for, where will these funds come from?
*   This complex will add significant traffic to the area, will you be upgrading roads to cope and what is the benefit to Monash residents?
*   Why are you displacing the Halcyon dementia support centre?
*   How can you buffer noise and visual impact from residents' current views and quiet enjoyment?
*   How significant will the drainage be considering the area floods regularly?
*   What environmental and ecological studies did you, or will you do?
*   How much soil and earth works will need to be completed?
*   Council often refers to community surveys as the basis for informing decisions.  Community members who answered the Tennis Survey say that had they known the intent was around a large tennis complex they would have answered the survey very differently.  Does Council feel that these surveys are transparent enough in their intent?

### TENNIS

*   Why has council appeared to underfund tennis infrastructure over the past 10yrs in Monash?
*   Why did you not consult tennis players for their needs prior to submission?
*   It has been indicated that local tennis clubs will be forced to relocate. What does this mean? Will the Council make conditions onerous when the lease is renewed such that members have no option but to move?
*   What will be the cost to the displaced tennis players who are forced to move to the new centre? Information from Boroondara tennis centre is that court hire weekdays up to 5 pm is $30/hr and weekends and after 5pm $38/hr. There is no allowance for an annual club membership. What will be the availability of courts at the tennis centre?
*   What happens to displaced local tennis players and interclub competition when tournaments are in progress? \
    (Boroondara advertise that they have 40 tournaments each year which they say may be the highest number of tennis tournaments held at any venue in Australia).
*   Is this facility to be a commercial tennis facility with show courts and tournaments?  How many tournaments will be held each year.  Is the amount of tournaments a condition of the agreement with NELP?
*   Is North East Link and the State Government dictating what is “required” in the courts form and surfaces?
*   What will the playing surface be on the new Federation (ITF) standard courts?

### GOLF

*   Why should golfers lose their driving range for tennis?
*   The driving range is always busy, what evidence was used to measure the current usage of the driving range?
*   Do you expect Golf membership to decrease with the removal of the driving range?
*   How long do you expect golf users to be impacted by construction or how long will the course be closed?
*   Can you promise the sound level of PA systems will not ruin the quiet enjoyment and focus of golfers?
