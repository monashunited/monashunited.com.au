Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding an article or fixing a bug? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/monashunited/monashunited.com.au/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

This goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.

## Pull Requests

To help out try to avoid creating pull requests on `master` and instead branch off of `develop`. It's much easier to test, merge, and roll them into new releases this way.
